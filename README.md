# About
[FreeRTOS](http://www.freertos.org/), ported to the
[Texas Instruments TM4C123GLX Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl), 
i.e. an evaluation board with the 
[TI TM4C123GH6PM](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tm4c123gh6pm.pdf)
microcontroller, based on ARM&#xae; Cortex-M4F.

The current version is based on FreeRTOS 10.4.0. The port will be regularly
updated with newer versions of FreeRTOS when they are released.

The port is still at an early development stage and includes only very basic
demo tasks. More complex tasks will be included in the future.
